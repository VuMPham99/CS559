1. What is the difference between a bump map and a normal map?

- They are similar except that normal has more information due its usage of the x,y,z axis while it's more 1 dimensional.

2. What is the difference between a "correct skybox" and simply putting a big cube around the world?

- Correct skybox would move with the camera to keep a constant distance while simply putting a big cube around the world doesnt (it stays still).

3. Why is a sphere a good object for environment mapping, but a flat square is less good?

- Because flat square still has edges, which make them more disruptive. With the sphere, all points have the same distance, while with a square the corners are further away than the centers, which could cause issues.

4. What are the main choices for how to represent environment map images? Why might you pick one or the other?

- The most common ones are cubic environment map, Cylindrical Environment Maps, and spherical environment map. Using cube is easy as it only needs 6 pictures, but sphere is easy because taking pictures to use for it (sphere) is easier than cube's.
