My town's theme is "My hobbies". I was envisoning if i had more resources and time in real life i would be able to build actual replicas of the things i like in phantasy sci-fi movies. That is why i have a skybox with background of a studio room with the groundplane acts as a table. The objects are replicas and they goes beyond imagination to blend in with each other despite being in different movies and era.
